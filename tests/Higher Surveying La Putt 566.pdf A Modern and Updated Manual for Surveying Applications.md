Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
Higher surveying is a branch of surveying that deals with the measurement and representation of the earth's surface and its gravity field. Higher surveying is also known as geodetic surveying or geomatics. Higher surveying is different from lower surveying or plane surveying, which assumes that the earth is flat and ignores the effects of curvature and gravity.
 
Higher surveying is important for various applications, such as mapping large areas, establishing national and international boundaries, determining geodetic positions and heights, monitoring crustal movements and deformations, studying the earth's shape and gravity field, and supporting navigation and geospatial information systems.
 
Higher surveying requires the use of sophisticated instruments and methods, such as satellite positioning systems, aerial photography, laser scanning, digital image processing, geographic information systems, and computer software. Higher surveying also requires the knowledge of advanced mathematics, physics, astronomy, geodesy, photogrammetry, and cartography.
